# RNTracker

RN (Right Now) Tracker is a simple React Native application allowing daily counting of a habit of choice, towards a specified goal.

The aim of the project was to explore the usage of 3D graphics rendering and general purpose computing on the GPU, as part of a real-world mobile application.
It allowed to assess the state of the GPU access technology in React Native, its stability, performance and usefulness. 
On top of that it sparked inspiration for finding useful implementation patterns and creating some designated tools.
